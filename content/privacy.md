There are several places on this website that requires you to identify yourself:

## Comments

I am using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) as a commenting system. To control your data with Disqus, you can:

- [read the general policy](https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance) by Disqus concerning the GDPR Compliance
- [read the privacy FAQ](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/privacy-faq)
- [opt out from information gathering](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/) by Disqus
- [delete or access your user data](https://help.disqus.com/commenting/gdpr-delete-or-access-user-data)

## Contact

The contact form is a service by [formspree](https://formspree.io/). They only store contents of the last 100 form submissions and delete the rest. Formspree is [open source so that you can check](https://github.com/formspree/formspree), what they are doing. The emails themselves are sent using another [open source](https://github.com/sendgrid) project: [SendGrid's API](https://sendgrid.com/), so on that end, their [privacy policies](https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/) apply.

By filling out the form, I get your name, email address, and your text. I will do nothing except handling your mailed concern. I will delete all mail sent by formspree at the latest after 12 months.

## Google Analytics

The only personal information collected while you visit this site is non-identifying information, such as browser type and operating system. This information is collected by [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) for measuring visitor traffic to this site.

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times and referring website address. This information is presented to me as aggregated reports to gauge visitor traffic and trends.

This information is collected via cookies. Most web browsers allow you to control the handling of cookies. To the best of my knowledge, you can disable all cookies for this website without in any way reducing the functionality for you. [Read here](https://cookiesandyou.com/) to learn what cookies are and how to control or disable them.

I have set the [GDPR options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings) of the static site generator I am using (Hugo) so that your IP address is anonymized within Google Analytics and the "Do Not Track" request is respected.
